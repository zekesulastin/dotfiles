#Zeke's Dotfiles

(Or at least a small subset)

This should be able to be cloned right into (my) home directory (you probably shouldn't if you're just looking ...).  The eventual endstate is to be able to use this repo on every machine I (regularly) use, including my home server and my ancient iBook G3 of awesomeness.  This, of course, adds ~entertainment~ to my setup - note the hostname checks and (eventually) the lowres branch to deal with font sizes.

Note 1: I removed the separator drawing from i3bar's xcb.c; the kludge is so ugly I refuse to provide a patch :/

Note 2: my configs refer to PragmataPro patched with the Powerline symbols, which is unable to be gitified due to licensing issues.  Go find it yourself if you want to use it.  I'm (eventually) going to have a git repo finished for Tamzen w/ Powerline, though!
