#Zeke's Dotfiles

(Or at least a small subset)

This should be able to be cloned right into (my) home directory (you probably shouldn't if you're just looking ...) ; ignores are set in ~/.git/info/exclude to avoid hilarious nested .gitignore issues with my ~/src directory until such times as I write a good .gitignore.

The eventual endstate is to be able to use this repo on every machine I (regularly) use, including my home server and my ancient iBook G3 of awesomeness.  This, of course, adds ~entertainment~ to my setup.
