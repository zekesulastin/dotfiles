#Zeke's Dotfiles

(Or at least a small subset)

This should be able to be cloned right into (my) ~ (you probably shouldn't if you're just looking >.>) ; ignores are set in ~/.git/info/exclude to avoid hilarious nested .gitignore issues.

Notably included is:
```
bash
i3 (won't work w/o separatorless i3bar)
termite
w/e else you see
```
