#Zeke's Dotfiles
(Or at least a small subset)

Obligatory screenshot (from Arch Linux's October screenshots thread):

This should be able to be cloned right into (my) home directory (you probably shouldn't if you're just looking ...).  The eventual endstate is to be able to use this repo on every machine I (regularly) use, including my home server and my ancient iBook G3 of awesomeness.  This, of course, adds ~entertainment~ to my setup - note the hostname checks and such.

Note: I removed the separator drawing from i3bar's xcb.c; the kludge is so ugly I refuse to provide a patch :/

There are a bunch of files used that I can't stick here due to licensing reasons - just keep an eye out for missing fonts/sounds and such if you don't reconfigure.
